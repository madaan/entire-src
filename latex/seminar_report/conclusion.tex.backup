\chapter{Conclusion}
The potential of open web can only be harnessed to its full extent by adding structure to it. The process involves 
creating structured repositories derived from the web that can answer interesting questions pertaining to entities
that exist on the web. 

Many such smart applications that rely on structured web will rely on frequencies of occurrence of the former. 
The report has been a buildup to achieving that.
We started by briefing what knowledge bases are. In the second part, we introduced the problem of disambiguating the
mentions of named entities and presented solutions roughly spanning last 8 years of research in the field. 

In the third part, we then elaborated on what is meant by aggregate statistics and presented several applications of the same. 
We presented maximum mean discrepancy via an example and discussed the formulation. We briefly outlined how mmd can be applied for
the estimating occurrence statistics of entities.
