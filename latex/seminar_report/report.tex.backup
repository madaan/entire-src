\begin{abstract}
The Internet is a web of mostly unstructured knowledge woven around things. However, these things; people, places, technologies, movies, products, books
etc. are mostly just mentioned by their name, with other crucial bits of information about them scattered around the point of mention. The cosmic scale of 
such unstructured information has stemmed the dream of a semantic web. A web which is aware of the links that make sense, which \emph{understands} what the 
user is looking for and which is gifted with the intelligence of locating the desideratum.

There are several pieces in the puzzle of the semantic web, this report is an attempt to understand one important piece; entities on the web and
their co occurrence statistics.
