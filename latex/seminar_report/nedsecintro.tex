\section{Named Entity Disambiguation Techniques}
We have already given an introduction to the problem and the applications in the introduction.
The next section discusses the solutions based on local disambiguation, i.e., figuring 
out the correct entity based on just the local evidences. Section 3.2 discusses the intuition
behind having a global strategy for disambiguation, and the optimization problem that
results from such an objective. The final section summarizes a recent work which 
pragmatically selects global and local evidences, to get the best of both worlds.
