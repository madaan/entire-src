 \frametitle{Keyphrase based similarity}
 Given a mention, m, we have all the candidate entities ($E$) with their respective keyphrase sets.
 We need to find sim(m, e) for all $e \inE$
 
 \begin{itemize}  
  \item For a given entity, for each keyphrase, find its \emph{cover}.  \medskip
  \item \textemph{Cover} : Shortest window of words that contains maximal number of words of the keyphrase. \medskip
  \item Keyphrase : ``Grammy Award Winner'' \medskip
  \item ``He has been the  \textcolor{green}{winner of many awards during his long career including the Grammy}''  \medskip
\end{itemize}
