\begin{itemize}
\item[\textcolor{red}{$\bullet$}] Distant supervision assumption, any sentence containing the entity pair will express the corresponding relation
\item[\textcolor{green}{$\bullet$}] Can quickly label huge corpora
\item[\textcolor{red}{$\bullet$}] Same entity pair can match different relations (Founded(Steve Jobs, Apple) or CEO(Steve Jobs, Apple))
\item[\textcolor{red}{$\bullet$}] False positives, may lead to model learning wrong patterns for relations
