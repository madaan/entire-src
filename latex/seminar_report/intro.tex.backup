\section{Problem Statement}
\section{Structure}
The report is divided into three parts.

The first part gives an overview of what are knowledge bases. This is important 
since the concept of such repositories of structured knowledge is central to the
report. 

The second part begins with an introduction to the problem of named entity disambiguation, the 
terminology and applications, and goes on to cover the techniques for named entity disambiguation
in some detail. We give and overview of the two broad categories of disambiguation techniques, Local and
global disambiguation.

The third part begins with a discussion on definition of Aggregate statistics and 
some of their applications. Finally, we discuss Maximum mean discrepancy and its 
application for estimating the aggregate statistics over entities.
