\begin{frame}{Local Disambiguation}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Resolve each mention oblivious to the other disambiguations \medskip
  \item Need to disambiguate a mention by collecting the local evidences \medskip
  \item \textbf{Evidences}  POS tags, gender information, dictionary lookup \medskip
  \item \textbf{Local}  We cannot use the disambiguation information for any of the other entities for solving the problem \medskip
  \item Techniques
  \begin{itemize} 
  \item Machine Learning Based
  \item Rule Based
  \item Recent Rule based 
 \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Local Disambiguation : Rule Based}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Stems from the classical problem of word sense disambiguation \medskip
 \item Example : Lesk's Algorithm \medskip
  \begin{block}{Lesk's Algorithm} \medskip
       
 For each mention, pick the candidate sense for which there is maximum overlap
 in the gloss (definition) of the candidate and the context
\end{block}
\item Note that the possible mentions are those that are identified by the named entity recognizer
 \end{itemize}

 \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Jimmy Page}\footnote{First para of the Wikipedia Entry} James Patrick "Jimmy" Page, OBE (born 9 January 1944) is an English musician, songwriter and record producer who achieved international success as the \textcolor{red}{guitar player} and leader of the rock band Led Zeppelin.
  \item \textbf{Larry Page}\footnote{First para of the Wikipedia Entry}	 Lawrence "Larry" Page[2] (born March 26, 1973) is an American Business magnate and computer scientist who is the co-founder of Google, alongside Sergey Brin. On April 4, 2011, Page succeeded Eric Schmidt as the chief executive officer of Google.[3][4] As of 2014, Page's personal wealth is estimated to be US\$32.3 billion, ranking him \#19 on the Forbes list of billionaires.[1]

\begin{frame}{Local Disambiguation : Rule based : Drawbacks}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Context can be misleading \bigskip
 \textcolor{green}{\emph{Amazon} saw a flood of visitors} \bigskip
 \item Context can be insufficient (or even absent!) \bigskip
 \item Rule based disambiguation has made a comeback with AIDA \bigskip
 \item ML based local disambiguation to come
