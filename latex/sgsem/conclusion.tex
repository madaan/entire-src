\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item The potential of open web can only be harnessed to its full extent by adding structure to it \medskip
  \item \emph{Web is structured around entities} \medskip
  \item Many such smart applications that rely on structured web will rely on frequencies of occurrence of the entities \medskip
  \item Named entity disambiguators have matured over the last 8 years, with the focus now shifting towards
  improving speed of such systems \medskip 
 \item It remains to be seen how approaches based on direct estimation of entity occurrence ratios perform in comparison with the standard tools, both in terms of speed and accuracy.
